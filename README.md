# Project Exam 1 - Frontend year 2022 

## Task
Exam task was to create a webpage with a blog theme, i chose a workout blog, using Wordpress as a Headless CMS. The website had some requirepents like at least 12 blog posts with a load-more function, image modal, and a carousel slider. 
JavaScript was quite new to me here so i struggled a lot with the functions. Loadmore and image modal works fine but my slider didnt turn out as planned. I will go in an fix this when I get the time, since I have learned a lot more now.
